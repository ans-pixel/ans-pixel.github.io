                            In our lab, diversity is not an add-on or an exception — it’s part of who we are. We aim to
                            create
                            an environment where everyone feels a genuine sense of belonging, valued for their
                            contributions
                            and
                            perspectives, and able to do their best science without feeling the need to fit into a
                            mould.
                            Differences in culture, background, and experience are not just respected but welcomed as
                            part
                            of a
                            shared purpose.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This does not mean we take diversity and inclusion lightly. We actively discuss adjustments,
                            flexible working arrangements, and other needs during onboarding, and revisit them by
                            default at
                            probationary meetings and annual appraisals. We also welcome staff and students to raise
                            these
                            topics at any time, knowing they will be taken seriously and handled with care. By combining
                            openness, respect, and curiosity with practical support, we aim to build something bigger
                            than
                            any
                            one of us could achieve alone.

                            Our lab culture is founded on mutual respect, accountability and a shared drive to enjoy the
                            process
                            of uncovering the secrets of biology. We expect everyone to contribute to an environment
                            where
                            people feel heard, valued, and supported. This means showing up prepared, engaging
                            thoughtfully
                            with
                            others’ work, being open to different viewpoints and receiving feedback with the same
                            openness
                            and
                            respect you’d expect when giving it. We do not tolerate discrimination or harmful behaviour

                            any
                            kind. Every lab member plays a role in shaping a space where it’s safe to speak up, ask
                            questions
                            and offer feedback.

                            The way we work is guided by self-motivation, curiosity and a shared drive to have fun
                            discovering
                            the secrets of biology. We want people to feel excited about what they are working on and
                            confident
                            in taking initiative. We are here to support, guide, and help clear the path when needed,

                            trust everyone to take ownership of their work, challenge themselves and grow into their

                            The working language of the lab is English. All professional communication — both oral and
                            written — must be in English. This includes presentations, discussions in lab meetings,
                            scientific output and email correspondence. Lab members are welcome to use AI to proofread
                            and refine written work; however, fully AI-generated text is not acceptable and must not be
                            presented as your own.

                            Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: people should
                            adopt the common language that allows everyone present to participate.

                            Our lab is committed to minimising waste and energy use, recognising our responsibility to
                            reduce the environmental impact of our research. We focus on four key areas: reducing waste
                            and recycling, economical use of equipment, and sustainable travel. We currently hold a Gold
                            certification with LEAF especially thanks to efforts from Inês Do Lago E Baldaia and Ben
                            Jackson, but critically also from everyone’s participation and engagement. Note that LEAF
                            certification is mandatory for Wellcome funding applications and renewals. Please see more
                            details under General Lab Procedures for more info on how we minimise our environmental
                            impact in the lab.

                            Authorship can sometimes be ambiguous, but our general principle is that all significant
                            contributors to a paper are included as authors, with contributions defined broadly
                            according to the CRediT Taxonomy. We don’t believe in authorship gatekeeping or that papers
                            are worth less if there are more authors. <br>

                            Examples of contributions that typically do not merit authorship (but may be acknowledged)
                            include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                            Because the scientific process is unpredictable, <b>authorship will be discussed when a lab
                                member begins or becomes involved in a project</b>, and can be revisited as the work
                            progresses,
                            with the <b>final decision made at the time of writing the manuscript</b>, when everyone’s
                            contributions can be evaluated as a whole. The final decision lies with the PI who will
                            consult with everyone involved and who will strive to be fair and transparent. Whenever
                            possible, we publish a <b>matrix of contributions</b> at the end of each paper to clearly
                            document
