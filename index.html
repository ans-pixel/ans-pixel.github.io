                            The mammalian brain has three fundamental parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem 
                            (consisting of the pons and the medulla). These three regions are functionally distinct, with the 
                            cerebrum being responsible for higher cognitive function and is also the seat for sensory process
